# keep-to-zettelkasten
Notebook to convert Google Keep to Zettelkasten notes

Takes JSON notes generated by Google Takeout, and converts them into Markdown Zettelkasten notes (with datetime in the beggining).
Then the script saves the notes to the folders by years.
Also removes all emojis and other symbols from the title, so the notes can be syncronized across platforms.
If title is not available, takes the title from the link's desription.

Saves tags from the original notes and adds #google_keep hashtag.

Based on https://github.com/hlibt/keep-to-markdown

**Requirements**: Python 3, Jupyter notebooks
